## Save User Info with Your Lex Chatbot
- Here implement the chatbox so that it Remember information stored in CheckBalance using context tag. We use the Output context tag which remember information about some specific details after an intent is finished, so other parts of the conversation can use this stored information later. For example, the account type from BalanceCheck could be saved and reused.

- i the create a follouCheckBalance Intent which configure the chatbot  not to ask for user age or banktype before it shows user's account balance
